Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

I'm Vittorio, a passionate Computer Science student from Germany. Before embarking on my current studies, I pursued a degree in Business Administration at the University of Wuppertal. However, over time, I discovered my true passion lies in Computer Science. This realization led me to make the bold decision to discontinue my Business studies and transition into Computer Science. 💻

In my current study program at the University of Wuppertal, I've gained initial programming experience, particularly with the C language. My curiosity and enthusiasm for technology and programming drive me to continuously learn and expand my skill set. 📚

On my GitHub profile, you will find a selection of my projects and work, reflecting my learning journey and progress in the world of Computer Science. ✍️

Feel free to explore and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or are interested in collaborating. 👨‍🎓

Best regards, Vittorio
